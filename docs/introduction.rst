Introduction
------------

PyHDX is software to extract H/D exchange kinetics from HDX-MS data sets in terms of Gibbs free energy of exchange (ΔG)
at the residue level.

An interactive web server is available where users can upload HDX-MS data and obtain ΔG values. Please refer to the
`GitHub <https://github.com/Jhsmit/PyHDX>`_ page for up-to-date links to the web server.

PyHDX analysis can also be ran headless from python scripts. The 'templates' directory on GitHub lists several examples.
